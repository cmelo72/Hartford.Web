                            <p>
                                Hartford Materials is a subsidiary of Hartford Paving Corporation, easily located
                                off Exit 5 from Rt.295 in Johnston, Rhode Island. Hartford Paving was founded in
                                1974 by my father, Anthony Corsinetti, Sr., as a general contractor paving driveways,
                                parking lots and roadways. This family owned and operated business prides itself
                                on its family-oriented values and a hard work ethic exemplified by my father. My
                                brother Anthony and I, Chris, worked alongside of him for many years until his unexpected
                                and untimely death at age 60 in 2002. Since then, Hartford Paving has expanded into
                                a new business venture called Hartford Materials. It was an idea that my father
                                had when there were plans to construct new exit ramps for the landfill, which went
                                right by our location. Unfortunately, he never got to see the ramps nor his new
                                business venture kick into action. However, based on the very same values he taught
                                us that made Hartford Paving a success for the past 35 years, Hartford Materials
                                is a growing company that will service the needs of landscape and mason contractors,
                                as well as the homeowner. We offer a complete line of concrete paving stones and
                                retaining walls from Nicolock, as well as Bluestone flagging and stair treads. We
                                also have natural wall stone and veneers, thin and manufactured veneers. Hartford
                                Materials has all the products even for the small projects around the home like
                                granite cobblestones, decorative crushed stones, mulch and much more. We recently
                                expanded our product line with small equipment such as generators, pressure washers,
                                compactors and pumps to name a few. We have an experienced staff that will take
                                the time to help determine which product best suites your needs. Over the past eight
                                years, Hartford Materials provided service and products for homeowners and contractors
                                throughout the state with the courtesy and respect instilled into us by our parents.
                                It is the same tradition of family values and hard work that started with our parent
                                company, Hartford Paving. Although my father isn’t here to share in all the changes
                                made to our company in the last 10 years, he is still the driving force and our
                                motivation for success. He and our mother made a lot of sacrifices for our family
                                and the business when it was started from scratch. The best way for my brother and
                                I to repay them is to continue the tradition of hard work and dedication to a business
                                that will be associated with the Corsinetti name forever.</p>
